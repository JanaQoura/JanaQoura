## About me 
 Iâ€™m a Computer Science and AI student at Beni-Suef University, specializing in AI and Data Science, with a growing passion for frontend development. My journey began with problem-solving in C++ and evolved into a love for blending data-driven logic with sleek, user-centric design. Now, I build dynamic interfaces with React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS where functionality meets artistry.
